            <p>I was born in Los Angeles California on January 11, 2000. On my free time I usually 
            go over to my friendâ€™s house or play my Xbox one with my friends online. 
            On the weekend I usually stay up all night playing with my friends. 
            If I am not doing that then I am usually helping my mom around the house or just in 
            my room playing Clash of Clans and listening to music. 
            Eventually I want to buy some equipment to start recording and making videos with my friends.</p>
            <p>Some stuff about my family is that I have one sister and two brothers. 
            I only live with my mom and my brothers. My sister lives with my dad. I see
            my sister and my dad every day so it is not that big of a deal that they do 
            not live with me. My dream vacation is to go to Brazil or Italy one day. I 
            would like to go there one day because I think those places are really cool 
            and you can learn a lot things from these places.</p>
